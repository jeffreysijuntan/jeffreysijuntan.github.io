I graduated with highest distinction from the University of Virginia with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Mathematics. During my undergraduate study, I worked with Professors [David Wu](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/dwu4/) and [Yuan Tian](https://www.ytian.info/) on scalable privacy-preserving machine learning, and with Professors [Haifeng Xu](https://www.haifeng-xu.com/) and [Xiaohui Bei](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/xhbei/) on handling miscalibration in peer reviews. 

My research lies in cryptography, machine learning, and distributed systems. I am mainly interested in research in the following two directions: 1) build systems that can protect users' data privacy by leveraging cryptographic tools. 2) studying cryptographic primitives that can improve the scalability, verifiability, and privacy of blockchain.
