I am a third-year CS PhD student at UC Berkeley, advised by [Raluca Ada Popa](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~raluca/). I am affiliated to Berkeley's [Sky Computing Lab](https://sky.cs.berkeley.edu/).

Previously, I graduated from University of Virginia with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Mathematics, where I was advised by [David Wu](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~dwu4/) and [Yuan Tian](https://www.ytian.info/). I also worked with Professors [Haifeng Xu](https://www.haifeng-xu.com/) and [Xiaohui Bei](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/xhbei/). I interned at [Facebook AI Research](https://ai.meta.com/) (FAIR) and worked at [Ant Group](https://www.antgroup.com/en) as a senior algorithm engineer.

My work spans **machine learning**, **computer security**, and **applied cryptography**. Currently, I am focused on advancing security, safety, and alignment of **Generative AI**. 

I am looking for highly motivated undergrads to work with! If you are interested in research opportunities, please send me an [email](mailto:sijuntan@berkeley.edu).
