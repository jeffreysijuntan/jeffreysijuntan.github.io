I am a second-year CS PhD student at UC Berkeley, advised by [Raluca Ada Popa](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~raluca/). I am affiliated to Berkeley's [Sky Computing Lab](https://sky.cs.berkeley.edu/).

Previously, I graduated from University of Virginia with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Mathematics, where I was advised by [David Wu](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~dwu4/) and [Yuan Tian](https://www.ytian.info/). I also worked with Professors [Haifeng Xu](https://www.haifeng-xu.com/) and [Xiaohui Bei](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/xhbei/).


I am interested in system security, machine learning, and applied cryptography. If you are interested in research collaboration, please shoot me an [email](mailto:sijuntan@berkeley.edu).

<!-- My research interest lies in cryptography and computer security. In particular, I study cryptographic primitives such as Secure Multi-party Computation (MPC) and Zero-knowledge Proof (ZKP), and leverage them to build decentralized systems. If you are interested in research collaboration, please shoot me an [email](mailto:sijuntan@berkeley.edu). -->

<!-- My research lies in cryptography, machine learning, and distributed systems. I am mainly interested in research in the following two directions: 1) build systems that can protect users' data privacy by leveraging cryptographic tools. 2) studying cryptographic primitives that can improve the scalability, verifiability, and privacy of blockchain.   -->
