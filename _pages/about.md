I am a third-year CS PhD student at UC Berkeley, advised by [Raluca Ada Popa](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~raluca/). I am affiliated to Berkeley's [Sky Computing Lab](https://sky.cs.berkeley.edu/).

Previously, I graduated from University of Virginia with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Mathematics, where I was advised by [David Wu](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~dwu4/) and [Yuan Tian](https://www.ytian.info/). I also worked with Professors [Haifeng Xu](https://www.haifeng-xu.com/) and [Xiaohui Bei](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/xhbei/). I interned at [Facebook AI Research](https://ai.meta.com/) (FAIR) and worked at [Ant Group](https://www.antgroup.com/en) as a senior algorithm engineer.

My current research focuses on **LLM post-training** and **Agentic AI**. I am the project lead at [Agentica](https://agentica-project.com/index.html), and we are on a mission to democratize reinforcement learning for training language models and agents.

We are looking for highly motivated students to work with! If you are interested in research opportunities, please send me an [email](mailto:sijuntan@berkeley.edu).
